        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a pattern of programming that focuses on classes and objects.
            Programming done with OOP allows each object to have its own procedures and method. In addition, OOP focuses on the
            logic and relationships between these objects. Four main concerns of OOP is encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance,
            and polymorphism.
        </p>
        <p>This article will give a brief introduction to OOP, and how OOP is used in a calculator program.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Encapsulation</h4>

        <p>
            Encapsulation describes wrapping data and methods that work on data within one unit. This restricts direct access
            to certain variables and methods, unless allowed to do so. To change the data within a certain object, it can only
            be done using the object's method. These variables within the object are known as private variables.
        </p>

        <p>
            Encapsulation is very useful because it protects data from accidentally being changed.
        </p>


        <div style ="margin-left: 40px">
    <h5>Encapsulation in Calculator Program</h5>
        <p>
            We use encapsulation in our calculator program by creating classes that has it owns methods, variables, and functions.
            For example, we have classes for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We also have a class for
            the history of calculations. The history of calculations is stored in a list, and the history calculation class has a function
            to clear the history. Encapsulation ensures that a function class, such as the addition class, cannot clear the history of the
            history class. The clear history function only works for the appropriate class that is was designed for.

        <h4>Abstraction</h4>
        <p>
            Abstraction refers to the abstract classes that can be used as a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes
            allow us to create a set of methods that can be used for any child classes built from the abstract class.
        </p>

        <p>For example, we can create a class with an abstract method. Within this class, we can create other classes that
        have unique properties. However, we can use the abstract method of the parent class for each child class. Each child class
        has the abstract method despite being different classes. </p>


        <div style ="margin-left: 40px">
        <h5>Abstraction in Calculator Program</h5>
            <p>
                In the calculator program, we used abstraction for creating a base class that takes care
                of the input values for the calculator. This base class reduces redundancies and help provide many useful functions.
                The base class allows us to create an object, convert input values into a tuple, and convert the input values to floats.
                This base class is also used for our addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division classes. Rather than
                writing all these functions for every calculation class, we included it in the base class which the calculation class
                can use.
            </p>

            <a href="https://github.com/k3vinhu4ng/IS218calculator/blob/9892b27b068cbdad00d8fc0e8e6b6f6efc522c45/calculator/calculations/calculation.py#L4-L22"
               target="_blank" class="btn btn-outline-danger">View Example</a>
        </div>
        <hr>

        <h4>Inheritance</h4>
        <p>
            Inheritance is the ability of one class to inherit properties from another class. For example, child classes can inherit
            properties from parent classes.
        </p>

        <div style ="margin-left: 40px">
            <h5>Inheritance in Calculator Program</h5>
            <p>
                Inheritance is used a lot in our calculator program. Inheritance allows us to reuse fields and methods
                of existing classes. The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division classes inherit the properties of
                the calculation class that allow for multiple inputs, changing list to tuples, changing numbers to floats, and creating
                objects.
            </p>
            <p>Then, the calculation history class inherits properties from each calculation class, such as addition. For example, the history
            class now inherits the properties of the addition class because the history list includes the addition object, which has the
            result value and class type.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the calculator class inherits all the properties of the classes mentioned before. This hides
            the complexity of the code behind  one simple class.</p>

            <a href="https://github.com/k3vinhu4ng/IS218calculator/blob/9892b27b068cbdad00d8fc0e8e6b6f6efc522c45/calculator/calculator.py#L20-L23"

        <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
        <p>
            Polymorphism refers to having many forms. In programming, this means that the same function can be used for different types.
            For example, the Python function len() can be used for numbers, strings, and even lists.

        </p>

        <div style ="margin-left: 40px">
            <h5>Polymorphism in Calculator Program</h5>
            <p>
                A good example of polymorphism in the calculator program is the get_result() function. This function exists in
                the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division class. Despite being different classes, the
                get_result() function can be used for all of them. This is very similar to how the Python function len() can be
                used for many forms, such as numbers, strings and lists.
            </p>
