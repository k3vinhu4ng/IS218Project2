        <h4>Introducing Pytest</h4>
        <p>
            A good tool to help test our programs in python is Pytest.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Pytest, we can use two important tests - Linting and Coverage.
        </p>
        <div class="card w-75">
            <div class="card-header">
                Install Pytest
            </div>
            <div class="card-body text-danger">

                <code>pip install pytest</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <hr>
        <h4>Pylint</h4>
        <p>Pylint, or linting, allows us to test if our code is up to coding standards.
            Linting tests to make sure that we have fulfilled standardized practices of coding.
            </p>
        <p>A simple analogy would be to compare linting code to the MLA format used in writing.
            Linting is a way to check if our code fulfills the standardized format of coding used in the industry.</p>
        <p>To run linting on our program, type the following command into the terminal corresponding to your Python project.</p>
        <div class="card w-75">
            <div class="card-body text-danger">
                <code>pytest --lint</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>If you have any linting errors, the test will tell you. For example, linting will
        tell you where you have missed important documentation comments, or if you missed a next line
        at the end of your code.</p>

        <hr>

        <h4>Coverage</h4>
        <p>
            Another important test to use is the coverage test. This test makes sure that all the code
            you have written is used. Coverage reports will show you how many statements have been executed.
        </p>
        <p>To run a coverage test, enter the following code:</p>
        <div class="card w-75">
            <div class="card-body text-danger">
                <code>pytest --cov</code>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>This would show you if any of your statements have not been executed. In the report, you can see the
        coverage percentage for each file. Using coverage tests is also a great way to unit test our code.</p>

        <h4>Glossary of Object Oriented Programming Terms</h4>
    <br>
        <p><b>Factory - </b>In OOP, a factory is an object that
            creates other objects. The objects created are considered
            "new". More important, the use of factory objects, called factory method,
            is a very important concept in object oriented programming.
        </p>

        <p><b>Instantiation - </b> Instantiation is when we create an object. In
        object oriented programming, we instantiate a class when we created an object.
        This object is the concrete instance of the class.</p>

        <p><b>Object - </b> In programming, an object can be a variable,
            data structure, function, or method. In object oriented
         programming, an object is a combination of variables, functions, and
        data structures. A class would be an example of an object.</p>

        <p><b>Class - </b>A class is a predefined program code for created objects.
        We can implement specific functions or methods for a class that we want to design.</p>

        <p><b>Namespace - </b>A set of signs that are used to refer to and identify
        objects of various kinds. </p>

        <p><b>Constructor - </b>A special type of subroutine used to created an object. It prepares the
        new objects for use by accepting arguments that the constructor
        uses to set required variables.</p>

        <p><b>Fixture - </b>A fixture refers to test fixtures, which are sets of
        predefined values or states used to run a test. For a calculator program,
        a fixture would predefine certain variables, and we would use this fixture to test if
        the functions create the correct result.</p>

        <p><b>Type Hint - </b>Type hinting allows us to indicate the type
            value within our Python code.
        </p>

        <p><b>Type Cast - </b>Type casting allows us convert value types in Python.</p>

        <p><b>Unit Test - </b>Unit testing is a way to test code by testing individual units
        of code to make sure they are ready and free of errors.</p>

        <p><b>Static - </b>Static means that the corresponding
            variable or method is available at the class level, meaning that
        an instance of the class is not needed to access it.</p>

        <p><b>Class Method - </b>A class method is a method that is bound to the class
        and not the object of the class.</p>

        <p><b>Facade - </b>Facade refers to the facade pattern of programming
        design pattern. This is used in object oriented programming and helps
        hide the complexities of larger systems and provide simple interfaces
        for end users. A Facade can be a single class that represents an
        entire subsystem.</p>

        <p><b>Design Patterns Used - </b>There are many design patterns used in programming. A Facade is one of them.
        Factory method is also a design pattern used. Each design pattern has its own pros and cons.</p>

        <p><b>Method - </b>A method is code that only runs when it is called. In object oriented
            programming,
        a method is defined within an class. </p>

        <p><b>Property - </b>Property refers to the special values included in a class or object</p>
